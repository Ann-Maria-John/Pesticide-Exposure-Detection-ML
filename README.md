# Prediction of Human Health Risks to Agrochemicals using Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data used for the study on predicting renal risks due to pesticide exposure using various machine learning models. The study leverages data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2015-2016 to classify individuals into higher and lower risk categories for diagnosing renal failure and other health issues.

## Features

Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean, encode, and standardize the data.
Feature Selection: Techniques like p-value significant feature selection, SelectKBest, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
Imputation Methods: Comparison of KNN, constant, and median imputation.
Oversampling Techniques: Methods like SMOTE, Borderline SMOTE, ADASYN, and SMOTENC to handle class imbalance.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Detailed evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC score.
